The Fellowship of the Ring


Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
Six for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
	 * Feat. Korean traditional board game 3-6-9 lol *
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
